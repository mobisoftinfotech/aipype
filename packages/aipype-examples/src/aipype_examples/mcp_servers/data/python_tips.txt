Python Performance Optimization Tips

1. Use List Comprehensions
   Instead of: result = []
               for i in range(100):
                   result.append(i * 2)

   Use: result = [i * 2 for i in range(100)]

2. Leverage Built-in Functions
   Built-in functions like map(), filter(), and reduce() are implemented in C
   and are generally faster than equivalent Python loops.

3. Use Local Variables
   Local variable lookup is faster than global variable lookup. Import frequently
   used functions into local scope when working in loops.

4. Profile Before Optimizing
   Use cProfile or line_profiler to identify bottlenecks:
   python -m cProfile -s cumtime script.py

5. Use Generators for Large Datasets
   Generators don't load everything into memory at once:
   def large_range(n):
       for i in range(n):
           yield i

6. Minimize Dot Notation
   Cache frequently accessed object attributes:
   local_method = obj.method
   for i in range(1000):
       local_method(i)  # Faster than obj.method(i)

7. Use __slots__ for Classes
   Reduce memory footprint and improve attribute access speed:
   class Point:
       __slots__ = ['x', 'y']

8. Choose Right Data Structures
   - list: Fast iteration, slow search
   - dict: Fast lookup, more memory
   - set: Fast membership testing
   - deque: Fast append/pop from both ends

9. Avoid Global Variables
   They're slower to access and make code harder to test.

10. Use NumPy for Numerical Operations
    For array operations, NumPy is orders of magnitude faster than pure Python.
