Understanding Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables seamless integration
between AI applications and external data sources. Developed by Anthropic, MCP provides
a universal protocol for connecting AI models to various tools, databases, and services.

Key Features:
1. Universal connectivity - Connect to any data source or service
2. Standardized interface - Consistent API across different providers
3. Security built-in - OAuth, API keys, and access control
4. Bidirectional communication - Tools can both provide and request data

Benefits for Developers:
- Reduce integration complexity
- Write once, use everywhere
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier testing and maintenance

MCP Architecture:
The protocol uses a client-server model where:
- Servers expose tools and resources
- Clients (AI applications) discover and use these tools
- Communication happens over various transports (stdio, HTTP, SSE)

Use Cases:
- Database queries
- API integrations
- File system access
- Web searching
- Custom business logic

Getting Started:
To implement an MCP server, you can use frameworks like FastMCP (Python) or
the official MCP SDK. Servers expose tools using simple decorators, and clients
can discover and invoke these tools automatically.

Conclusion:
MCP represents a significant step toward making AI applications more powerful
and easier to integrate with existing systems. As the ecosystem grows, we can
expect more tools, servers, and integrations to become available.
